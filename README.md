# relevance-paradox

### Analyzing trends and phenomena including Simpson's paradox, Berkson's Paradox, and Lord's Paradox in real world Natural Language Data

#### Key Idea

<p align='justify'>An extractive summarization task can be framed as regression task where we try to assign a relevance label to every sentence in the article. Now, we can analyze trends in the data by plotting the normalized relevance score in the y-axis and various other factors such as length of the sentence, number of content words in the sentence, the content word count to text length ratio, norm of the semantic embedding vector, semantic similarity between the sentence and the document embedding, etc.</p>
